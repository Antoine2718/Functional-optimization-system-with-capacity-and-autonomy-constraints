# Functional optimization system for VRP with capacity and autonomy constraints

## Works
This project aims to solve a tour optimization problem with capacity and autonomy constraints.

Study of an initial solution, then application of an intra-tour 2-Opt, followed by a Tabu Search with Relocate and Swap (inter/intra-tour) movements.

• Swap: swap two clients between two tours or within the same tour.

• 2-Opt: intra-toured local improvement after each accepted move.
